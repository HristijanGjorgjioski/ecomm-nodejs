This app is built from one course that I have taken(after this
app I have started my 'facebook-clone' app). App is build in 
NodeJS. There was a lot to learn. I can say that I learned 
80% from that course and I am able to implement that knowledge
in my own app(I have showed that in 'facebook-clone' app). I 
have also learned a lot in this course about MongoDB and CSERF
token protection!
